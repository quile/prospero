# NAME

Prospero - Solve the hard problems, not the easy ones.

# VERSION

Version 0.1

# SYNOPSIS

Prospero is a platform-independent system for

- Building pages out of reusable components
- Handling complex dynamic forms transparently
- Structuring your display logic entirely separately
from everything else, allowing very easy "skin" changes, i18n, etc.

It is designed on solid engineering principles and has as its direct spiritual
ancestor Apple's __WebObjects__ framework.  It uses techniques found in
the __Cocoa__ framework (previously __NeXTStep__) to provide functionality
that will be familiar to programmers of __OSX__, __iOS__ and __WebObjects__.

It is not bound to any "popular" web framework and has no dependencies
on any of them, insofar as it is designed to be platform-neutral.  It can
function equally well within a web framework, as its own, or entirely off-line.
