Prospero

Prospero is a framework-independent toolset that will give
you the ability to render complex componentised web pages,
re-use components, and automatically handle incoming
requests from pages generated using those components.  In short,
it makes the hard stuff a lot easier.


This is a work-in-progress as I flesh out some ideas.
I will update this README as I get closer to a release.
